# ndt_omp
This package provides an OpenMP-boosted Normal Distributions Transform (and GICP) algorithm derived from pcl. The NDT algorithm is modified to be SSE-friendly and multi-threaded. It can run up to 10 times faster than its original version in pcl.

Several methods for neighbor voxel search are implemented. If you select pclomp::KDTREE, results will be completely same as the original pcl::NDT. We recommend to use pclomp::DIRECT7 which is faster and stable. If you need extremely fast registration, choose pclomp::DIRECT1, but it might be a bit unstable.
